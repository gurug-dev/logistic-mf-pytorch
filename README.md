# logistic-mf-pytorch
Simple Logistic Regression using Matrix Factorization in PyTorch

This is a simple Python project that implements logistic regression using matrix factorization in PyTorch. It can be used for collaborative filtering tasks such as recommendation systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or higher
- Numpy
- Pandas

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- `logistic_mf.py` contains the core logic to train the model on a toy dataset (tiny_data).
- You can also use `logistic_mf_helper.ipynb` or `test_logistic_mf.ipynb` to interact with the model in a Jupyter notebook.
- You can modify the hyperparameters and the dataset in the `logistic_mf.py` file.
